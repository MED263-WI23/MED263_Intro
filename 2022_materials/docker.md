## Operating System
An **operating system (OS)** is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs and it will enable users to interact with a computer system

Following are important functions of an OS
* device management
* file management
* job accounting
* memory managment
* processor management
* resource sharing
* scheduling
* security

**EXERCISE 1**: What kind of OS (and web browser) are you using?
Find it from [WhatIsMyBrowser](https://www.whatismybrowser.com)


## Bioinformatics and Linux
* Bioinformatics relies heavily on Linux-based computers (hardware) and software.
* Although many bioinformatics software tools are compiled on Mac OS and Windows,
it is more conveneint to install and run the software executables on a Linux system.

**EXERCISE 2**: What is the market share of linux in the Desktop platform?
Find it out from @[StatCounter](http://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide/#monthly-202012-202112-bar)


## Docker
Docker is a tool that allows developers, sys-admins etc. to easily deploy their applications in a sandbox (called containers) to run on the host operating system i.e. Linux.


## Key benefit of Docker
* The key benefit of Docker is that it allows users to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development.
* Unlike virtual machines, containers do not have the high overhead and hence enable more efficient usage of the underlying system and resources.


From Dockerfile to image to container

## Image vs. Container
* An **image** is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files.

* A **container** is a runtime instance of an image—what the image becomes in memory when actually executed. It runs completely isolated from the host environment by default, only accessing host files and ports if configured to do so.


## Container vs. Virtual Machine (VM)

[source: docker.com](https://www.docker.com/sites/default/files/d8/2018-11/container-vm-whatcontainer_2.png)
* Virtual machines run guest operating systems—note the OS layer in each box.
* This is resource intensive, and the resulting disk image and application state is an entanglement of OS settings, system-installed dependencies, OS security patches, and other easy-to-lose, hard-to-replicate ephemera.



Container diagram

[source: docker.com](https://www.docker.com/sites/default/files/d8/2018-11/docker-containerized-appliction-blue-border_2.png)
* Containers can share a single kernel, and the only information that needs to be in a container image is the executable and its package dependencies, which never need to be installed on the host system.
* These processes run like native processes, and you can manage them individually by running commands like ``docker ps``—just like you would run ps on Linux to see active processes.
* Finally, because they contain all their dependencies, there is no configuration entanglement; a containerized app “runs anywhere.”


## Install Docker
Docker Community Edition (CE) for your operating system
[Download and install Docker](https://store.docker.com/search?offering=community&q=&type=edition)


## Windows users only: enable virtualization in BIOS
When prompted, ensure the Enable Hyper-V Windows Features or the Install required Windows components for WSL 2 option is selected on the Configuration page.
[More details for Windows users](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/)


## Docker version
**EXERCISE 3**: What is the Docker version installed in your computer?
Do you have the most recent version? Find it by running 
```bash
# from the host computer
docker --version
```
in the terminal or Power Shell




## Hello World Test
1. Click **Docker Quickstart** icon to start Docker
2. Open a terminal and type
3. Open a terminal and type the following command
```bash
# from the host computer
docker run hello-world
```
4. Docker installation is success if you see the outputs like the one below
```
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly
To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.
```


## iAdmix Test
Given the called variant file (vcf), we want to estimate the ancestry of this individual by the list proportions of multiple reference populations that sums up to 1.
```bash
# from the host machine
docker run -ti j5kim/iadmix:latest /bin/bash /testrun/testrun.sh
```

**EXERCISE 4**: What is the ancestry of this individual? Report the estimated admixture proportions.
Consult the [HapMap3](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/downloads/human/hapmap3.html) to spell out the population acronyms.
