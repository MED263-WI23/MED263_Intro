### Python
#### What is Python
- Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. It is used across various disciplines and a common choice in bioinformatics. 
#### Why use Python?
- It is a relatively  fast programming language without complex syntax 
- It is extremely well documented and there are a lot of online resources if you run into isssues
- There are lots of built in and easily installable packages which allow you to do things such as manipulate csv files, creating plots and even perform machine learning

### Conda
#### What is Conda?
- Conda is an open source package management system and environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS and Linux.
#### Why use Conda?
- Often used in bioinformatic workflows & by bioinformatic scientists
- Allows for multiple package versions depending on the project (environment) you are working on
- Lots of packages already avalible for quick and easy download

### Jupyter Labs
#### What is Jupyter Labs?
- A web based notebook that allows for both writting and execution of code 
- Can run notebooks in both Python and R
#### Why use Jupyter Labs?
- Often used in bioinformatic workflows & by bioinformatic scientists
- Great for testing code with immediate feedback
- User friendly and reliable 

## Python & Conda

### Install Conda, which also installs Python ðŸ¤© 
In order to save time, we will be installing Miniconda (the mini version) instead of Anaconda (the full version).

1. Download Miniconda
   - Go to the webpage: (https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#installing)
   - If you you have a Mac choose **Miniconda3 MacOSX 64-bit bash**
   - If you have Windows choose **Miniconda3 Windows 64-bit**
   - If you have Windows with Ubuntu, choose **Miniconda3 Linux 64-bit**
   - Save the miniconda download in your **Downloads** folder
2. Mac and Linux/Ubuntu: Install Miniconda 
   - Start by opening up a terminal, then copy the commands below
```bash
cd Downloads
bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
```

2. Windows: Install Miniconda
   - Click on the downloaded conda ".exe" file and follow the prompts to install it.
   - Skip to **Create Conda Environment**

3. Test to ensure Miniconda was installed correctly  
**IF you have Ubuntu on Windows**, instead of $HOME, use the path you saved your Miniconda above
```bash
source $HOME/miniconda3/bin/activate
conda --help
```
4. Add Conda to your PATH  
**IF you have Ubuntu on Windows**, instead of $HOME, use the path you saved your Miniconda above
```bash
# Run the following to see what your shell is:
echo "$SHELL"

# If your default shell is bash, run:
printf '\n# add path to conda\nexport PATH="$HOME/miniconda3/bin:$PATH"\n' >> ~/.bashrc

# If your default shell is zsh, run:
printf '\n# add path to conda\nexport PATH="$HOME/miniconda3/bin:$PATH"\n' >> ~/.zshrc
```
5. **Close and re-open** your terminal for the environmental variable changes to take effect

6. Initialize your conda environment
```bash
conda init --help
```
7. **Close and re-open** your terminal for the environmental variable changes to take effect

### Create Conda Environment

Windows users (no Ubuntu): Do the following in an anaconda power shell

Mac, Linux and Windows with Ubuntu users: Do the following in a terminal
```bash
conda create -n med263_jupyter
```
- If this step doesn't work, try running *conda activate* first

### Activate Conda Environment
```bash
conda activate med263_jupyter
```
- To check your conda environment is working, you should see *(med263_jupyter)* on the left part of your terminal now

### Install python in the conda environment
```bash
conda install python
```

### Confirm that Python was Installed
```bash
python --version
```
- This command should report your current version of python and will likely say *Python 3.11.1*

### Install the package for this week (htslib comes with tabix)
```bash
conda install -c bioconda htslib
```  
Check to make sure that worked
```bash
tabix
```

Install scipy as well
```conda install -c anaconda scipy```

- **Windows users:** If that doesn't work, or you're getting an error related to *openssl*, try:
```bash
# First, navigate to your home directory (you may already be there)
cd %HOMEPATH%

# Then copy the following two files from one folder to another
cp anaconda3\Library\bin\libcrypto-1_1-x64.dll anaconda3\DLLs
cp anaconda3\Library\bin\libssl-1_1-x64.dll anaconda3\DLLs

# Then try installing the tabix package via htslib
conda install -c bioconda htslib
```
Install scipy as well
```conda install -c anaconda scipy``

## Install and Run Jupyter Labs
Now, that we have conda installed we can simply install jupyter labs. 
Before starting this step, make sure you are in the *(med263_jupyter)*  conda environment. If you are not, follow the instructions in the **Activate Conda Environment** step above to do so. 

### Install Jupyter Labs
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
```

### Start a Jupyter Lab
```bash
jupyter lab
```
- If this step isn't working, make sure you are in the *(med263_jupyter)* conda environment

### Install R on Jupyter Labs  
1. Start by opening a terminal, then run the following to create a new conda environment
```bash
conda create -n med263_R_jupyter
```

2. Activate the enviornment
```bash
conda activate med263_R_jupyter
```

3. Install R
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge r-base
```


4. Test to see if R was correctly installed
```bash
R --version
```

5. Install additional needed packages for R to run in jupyter
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
```
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge r-irkernel
``` 

6. Finally, check you installed everything correctly.
If the above steps were done right, you should now have the option of Python or R when starting Jupyter Notebooks.
```bash
jupyter lab
```

Your dashboard should look like the following:

## Intro to Python

### Basic Commands
1. Printing
```python
print("Hello World!")
```
2. Comments
 ```python
#This is a single line comment
'''
This is a 
multi-line
comment
'''
```
3. Basic For Loops  
In python, the tabs / spacing are necessary for the code to run properly
 ```python
sample_list = [1,2,3,4]
for items in sample_list:
   print(items)
```
Should print the following:
 ```python
> 1
> 2
> 3
> 4
```

4. Basic While Loop
 ```python
x = 0
while x < 5:
   x+=1
print(x)
```
Should print the following:
 ```python
> 5
```
