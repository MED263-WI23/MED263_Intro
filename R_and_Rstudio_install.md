## R
#### What is R?
R is an open source, free software language popular among data scientists and bioinformaticians. Its focus is on statistics and graphics.
"Under the hood", R is written in C and Fortran, but R itself is an interpreted language, meaning that there is no need to pre-compile. R will interpret and run the source code in one step.

#### Why use R
- Lots of great packages. If you're trying to do something, chances are there's a package for that
- Simple syntax and helpful error messages make coding relatively easy
- Rstudio is great
- Pretty pictures (compared to, for example, python)
- Almost all of the speakers in this class are doing something in R

#### What is Rstudio?
Rstudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) designed for writing and testing R code. 

#### Why use Rstudio
- Plots, variables, etc. can be easily viewed (helps with debugging)
- Easy to run specific lines or chunks of code (Command+Enter on mac, Ctrl+Enter on windows)
- Easy to search package and function documentation even when offline
- Helps with git and package development

### Install R
CRAN is your source for (almost) everything R: (https://cran.r-project.org/)
Here, we want to install a binary. This means that we just want the compiled version that runs on our operating system (OS). Sometimes, we will want to download all the code that is used to write R (or some other language/package) and then compile it ourselves.

The newest version of R is: R 4.2.2 "Innocent and Trusting" released on 2022/10/31
They always have weird names...

Because each OS is different, you need to download the binary which is specific to your OS:
#### Macs be careful. M1 and newer macs download one binary. Older intel macs download another.
